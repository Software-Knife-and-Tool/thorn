<h4 id="about-the-prelude-reader"><strong>about the prelude
reader</strong></h4>
<hr />
<p>The <em>prelude</em> reader converts a stream of characters to tagged
object forms.</p>
<h5 id="readtable">Readtable</h5>
<hr />
<p>A readable similar to the Common Lisp initial readable is included.
While <em>prelude</em> reader syntax may be altered by judicious
modification of this readable, it is intended to read in the
<em>prelude</em> and subsequent libraries. Significant changes to it
will probably cause read failures while trying to bootstrap the
system.</p>
<p>The current readtable is formatted as an association list and looks
like:</p>

<p><strong><em>Stream Designators</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>A <em>stream-designator</em> is either a <em>stream</em> object, or
the symbol <em>:t</em>, or (). The <em>:t</em> designator is an alias
for <em>mu:std-in</em>, and () is an alias for <em>mu:std-out</em>.
Functions that take stream designators map the designator to the
appropriate stream.</p>
<h5
id="read-stream-designator-eof-error-eof-value-value"><strong><em>read</em></strong>
<em>stream-designator</em> <em>eof-error</em> <em>eof-value</em> =&gt;

generalized boolean</dfn></br></p>
</div>
<p><em>read</em> is the <em>prelude</em> reader external interface. If
<em>eof-error</em> is <em>true</em>, an exception will be raised if
<em>read</em> is called on a <em>stream</em> that is at end of file. If
<em>eof-error</em> is <em>false</em>, <em>eof-value</em> will be
returned on end of file.</p>
