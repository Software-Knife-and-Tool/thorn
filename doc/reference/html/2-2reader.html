<h1 class="title">2.2 Core Reader</h1>
</header>
<h4 id="reader"><strong>Reader</strong></h4>
<hr />
<p>The core reader converts a stream of characters to values, and
resolves unqualified symbols in the current namespace.</p>
<h5 id="readtable">Readtable</h5>
<hr />
<p>A readable similar to the Common Lisp initial readable is included.
While core reader syntax may be altered by judicious modification of
this readable, it is used to read in the <em>preface</em> and subsequent
libraries and significant changes to it will probably cause read
failures while trying to bootstrap the system.</p>
<p>The current readtable is formatted as an association list and looks
like:</p>

<p><strong><em>Stream Designators</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>A <em>stream-designator</em> is either a <em>stream</em> object, or
the symbol <em>t</em>, or (). The <em>t</em> designator is an alias for
<em>mu:std-in</em>, and () is an alias for <em>mu:std-out</em>.
Functions that take stream designators map the designator to the
appropriate stream.</p>

<p><em>read</em> is the <em>core reader</em> external interface. If
<em>eof-error</em> is <em>true</em>, an exception will be raised if
<em>read</em> is called on a <em>stream</em> that is at end of file. If
<em>eof-error</em> is <em>false</em>, <em>eof-value</em> will be
returned on end of file.</p>
