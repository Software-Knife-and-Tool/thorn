#### **about the prelude reader**

------

The *prelude* reader converts a stream of characters to tagged object forms.

##### Readtable

------

A readable similar to the Common Lisp initial readable is included. While *prelude* reader syntax may be altered by judicious modification of this readable, it is intended to read in the *preface* and subsequent libraries. Significant changes to it will probably cause read failures while trying to bootstrap the system.

The current readtable is formatted as an association list and looks like:

```
   '((#\0 . constituent)  (#\1 . constituent)  (#\2 . constituent)  
     (#\3 . constituent)  (#\4 . constituent)  (#\5 . constituent)  
     (#\6 . constituent)  (#\7 . constituent)  (#\8 . constituent)  
     (#\9 . constituent)  (#\: . constituent)  (#\< . constituent)
     (#\> . constituent)  (#\= . constituent)  (#\? . constituent)  
     (#\! . constituent)  (#\@ . constituent)  (#xa . wspace)
     (#xd . wspace)       (#xc . wspace)       (#x20 . wspace)
     (#\; . tmacro)       (#\" . tmacro)       (#\# . macro)
     (#\' . tmacro)       (#\( . tmacro)       (#\) . tmacro)
     (#\` . tmacro)       (#\, . tmacro)       (#\\ . escape)       
     (#\| . mescape)      (#\a . constituent)  (#\b . constituent)
     (#\c . constituent)  (#\d . constituent)  (#\e . constituent)

     (#\- . constituent)  (#\/ . constituent)  (#\~ . constituent)  
     (#\. . constituent)  (#\% . constituent)  (#\& . constituent)
     (#\^ . constituent)  (#\_ . constituent)  (#\a . constituent)

     (#\t . constituent)  (#\u . constituent)  (#\v . constituent)
     (#\w . constituent)  (#\x . constituent)  (#\y . constituent)
     (#\z . constituent)))
```

***Stream Designators***

<hr>

A *stream-designator* is either a *stream* object, or the symbol *:t*, or (). The *:t* designator is an alias for *mu:std-in*, and () is an alias for *mu:std-out*. Functions that take stream designators map the designator to the appropriate stream.



##### ***read*** *stream-designator* *eof-error* *eof-value* => *value*

------


<div class="list">
<span class="dfn">stream-designator</span>: an input <span class="dfn">stream-designator</span></br>
<span class="dfn">eof-error</span>: a <span class="dfn">generalized boolean</span></br>
<span class="dfn">eof-value</span>: a <span class="dfn"> generalized boolean</span></br>
</div>

*read* is the *prelude* reader external interface. If *eof-error* is *true*, an exception will be raised if *read* is called on a *stream* that is at end of file. If *eof-error* is *false*, *eof-value* will be returned on end of file.
