#### **about prelude functions**

<hr>

*prelude* functions extend the fixed-arity *mu* function by accommodating rest arguments and closures.

Applications of *prelude* lambda functions will subsequently be compiled as a call to the fixed-arity *prelude:apply* function which
manages the function's lexical environment and arranges for *mu:apply* to correctly evaluate and process the arguments.

The *prelude* compiler compiles all forms so that they can be directly evaluated by the runtime evaluator.

##### apply *function* *arg-list* => *value*

------

<div class="list">
<span class="dfn">function</span> : a <span class="dfn">prelude</span> function</br>
<span class="dfn">arg-list</span>: a list of <span class="dfn">prelude</span> forms, possibly ()</br>
</div>



*apply* manages the runtime's lexical environment for closures and creates appropriate argument lists for the runtime evaluator.
